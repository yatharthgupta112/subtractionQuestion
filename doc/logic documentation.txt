non Borrowing subtraction
    - We generate minuend randomly with min and max based on no of digits
        like if minuend= 4 then min = 1000 and max =9999
    - Based on the random no i generate subtrahend in which every digit is smaller than corresponding digit in minuend to make them non borrowing. 
   
   
borrowing subtraction
    - We generate a random no which is less than the minuend and is of provided length.
    - Than we check if it has borrowing or not.
    - If it is not borrowing than we randomly randomise the random digits in the subtrahend with borrowing digits.
    - We repeat previous step until we have borrowing subtrahend
    - Also subtrahend cannot have 0 at first place
   
Option 
    -  Generate options based on answer to keep some similarity
            - One option is a random number with min = answer and max = answer +10
            - Another option is a random number with mod value of the result and 
                min = (answer -5) and max = answer
            -  One option is answer
            - One option is a random number of same no of digits as of the answer.

Randomising the option
    - I generate a random number suppose x.
    - Now we swap two random option from the array for x times.
    This gives us a array of options which is randomised
